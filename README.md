# Data Visualization Final Project

This repository contains a compilation of mini projects throughout the semester, all regarding Credit Union Analytics.

## Mini-Project 1

Location: `Mini-Project-1/`

The intend of this project is to explore the operating efficiencies of credit unions around the United States. This will be done by looking at the size of credit unions and their operational expenses. Along the way we will experiment with concepts learned from the glamour of graphics presenation as well as new markdown techniques to make the paper more interesting to read and more formal in structure.

## Mini-Project 2

The intend of this project is to explore spaital analytics as it pertains to Credit Union Branches as well as experiment in interactive plots for asset growth. This project also includes a regression for branch site selection.

## Mini-Project 3

This project was used as an opportunity to explore visualizations which had not been explored earlier in the semester, this was done using two datasets. The first was temperatures in Tampa, Florida in 2016 and 2017 provided by FSU's [Florida Climate Center](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/climate-data-access-tools/downloadable-data). This dataset was used to create the visualization below. I also created a bigram network using records from the Fforida Poly 2020 news.

### Moving Forward

I intend to further research ways of using Data Visualization to contribute to the development and expansions of Credit Unions, I believe this segment of the Financial Services market is underserved by analytics. With the experience gained from this project and the rest of this semester I have gained a greater respect for github and intend to use it for sharing any research I conduct into public Credit Union data.
