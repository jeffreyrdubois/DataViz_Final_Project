This repository contains a compilation of mini projects throughout the semester, all regarding Credit Union Analytics.

## Mini-Project 1

Location: `Mini-Project-1/`

The intend of this project is to explore the operating efficiencies of credit unions around the United States. This will be done by looking at the size of credit unions and their operational expenses. Along the way we will experiment with concepts learned from the glamour of graphics presenation as well as new markdown techniques to make the paper more interesting to read and more formal in structure.
