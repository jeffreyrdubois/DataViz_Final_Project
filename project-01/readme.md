## Mini-Project 1

The intend of this project is to explore the operating efficiencies of credit unions around the United States. This will be done by looking at the size of credit unions and their operational expenses. Along the way we will experiment with concepts learned from the glamour of graphics presenation as well as new markdown techniques to make the paper more interesting to read and more formal in structure.

The data for this project is found in three csv files:
<ol>
<li>NCUA_Data - 1.csv</li>
<li>NCUA_Data - 2.csv</li>
<li>AcctDesc.csv</li>
</ol>

The two NCUA_Data files should be merged together into one NCUA_Data.csv file.

NCUA_Data.csv is the main data file which holds the data to be analyzed in this project.
AcctDesc.csv holds column names and will be used to make the main data file more legible

In the /Report folder you will find the rmarkdown file as well as the .HTML version of the final report for this project.
